        <h2>The Language</h2>
        <p> Galician-Portuguese was the spoken language in the western area of the Iberian Peninsula
            until mid-fourteenth century. Derived from Latin, it emerged progressively as a
            different language before the ninth century, in the territories of the old Kingdom of
            Galicia, which covered the regions of modern day Galicia and northern Portugal. In this
            sense, we can say that the word Galician-Portuguese designates not only a language, but
            also a phase in its development, which later would lead to the differentiation between
            present Galician and Portuguese languages due to political and sociolinguistic
            circumstances.</p>
        <h2>Linguistic Analysis</h2>
        <p class="questions">How did the Portuguese pronoun system change throughout the Late Middle
            Ages?</p>
        <h3>Some History</h3>
        <p>Portuguese, like most other Romance languages, came from Latin, or more specifically, an
            altered form of Lating called "vulgar Latin". The transition from vulgar Latin to the
            Romance languages was due to maany factors, notably relative geographic isolation of the
            different groups of language users and subsequent linguistic superimposures by
            linguistic subtrate languages. An example of the linguistic superimposure is the
            intensified stress accent superimposed upon vulgar Latin of the Iberian Peninsula by
            invading German races. Vulgar Latin, along the western coast of the Iberian Peninsula,
            which had less of the Germanic stress accent than anywhere else, grew into Portuguese.
            The exact date of this trasformation is unclear but the earliest documents in Portuguese
            appeared at the end of the 12th century and mark the historical beginning of Old
            Portuguese. </p>
        <p>For four centuries, the language underwent amny changes, one of the most important being
            a marked intensification of the stress accent, which was represented by an increase in
            syncope found in verse and by the tendency toward greater word individuation. Toward the
            end of the 16th century, nearly all distinct characteristics of Old Portuguese
            disappeared, leaving the rough equivalent of the modern Portuguese spoken today. </p>
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>For the diachronic variation study, we chose a sample of authors from five time periods
            used to divide our timeline. Using the work of <a
                href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015034652472;view=1up;seq=1"
                >Williams (1962)</a>, we marked up pronouns and categorized them, using Williams's
            standards, as "old" or "new". Then, we determined how accurate the claims made by
            Williams are by looking at the distribution of the "old" and "new" pronouns across the
            five time periods.</p>
        <p>Williams' claim is that Old Portuguese appeared at the end of the 12th century and had
            completed its transformation into modern Portuguese by approximately the end of the 16th
            century. Our goal in looking at pronouns used in poetry of medeival Galician troubadors
            is to see if William's claims are represented in the distribution of pronouns across the
            poems. </p>
        <p>The Galician-Portuguese poetic movement remains a rich cultural event in the history of
            the Iberian Peninsula. The troubadors and mistrels who authored the songs were greatly
            revered, as were their works. Therefore, the Portuguese used in their poems could be
            seen as representative of the language being used at the time. If anything, it is one of
            the most consistent collections of texts because it spans roughly three centuries during
            the evolution of the language into modern Portuguese. By tracking the use of archaic and
            modern pronouns in the poems, we can begin to understand the timeline of how the
            Portuguese language changed over time.</p>
        <p>This, obviously, is just a scratch at the surface of language change. In this project, we
            only look at personal pronouns because they had quantifiable changes that could be
            easily recognized and marked. A more in-depth study might include other linguistic
            features, such as phonological features of orthography. We hope that this project might
            open the door for more research into this realm of study. </p>
        <h3>The Markup </h3>
        <p>After formatting the poems in an XML document, the next step was to mark all the personal
            pronouns that Williams mentioned in his study. Below are charts taken from William's
            research. </p>

        <p>In the texts, we used regex to mark all personal pronouns, modern and archaic, with the
            following tag:</p>
        <code>&lt;w ana="#pronoun"&gt; pronoun &lt;/w&gt;</code>
        <p>Importantly, we did not want to miss any pronouns that were hyphenated or had been
            assimilated into surrounding words. Therefore, we used the expression:</p>
        <p>Find:</p>
        <code>([^a-z])(mi[m]?)([^a-z]) </code>
        <p>Replace With:</p>
        <code>\1&lt;w ana="#pronounCode"&gt;\2&lt;/w&gt;\3</code>
        <p>The pronoun code refers to the features library document which is available to view on
            our GitHub. This allows us to find and calculate the pronouns based on their age
            classification, which is marked in the feature library. Using these labels, we will be
            able to calculate the percentage of modern and archaic forms and identify their
            distribution across the time spectrum of the poets.</p>
