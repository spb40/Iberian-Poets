        <h1>Mapping Medieval Galician-Portuguese Literature and its Networks</h1>
        <h2>About the Class</h2>
        <p>This project is a course requirement for Computational Methods in the Humanities, taught by David Birnbaum in the Fall semester of 2014 at the University of Pittsburgh</p>
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>There are two aspects of this project: the mapping and linguistic study. </p>
        <p>In the Middle Ages, the Galician-Portuguese lyric was a very important poetic school, since it was the language used in nearly all of Iberia for lyric poetry. Its significance lies in its status as the first cultural production documented in Galicia or Portugal and represents not only the beginnings but one of the high points of poetic history in both countries and Medieval Europe.
            To understand how this poetic school worked it is important to see the relations between the people involved. A map that depicts chronological and, obviously, geographical data can be a useful tool to visualize them.
            We may think that culture is about human beings, but mostly, culture is about power. Centers of cultural dynamism are always held in a way by some political agent. “Who was boss?” in the High and Late Middle Ages in the Iberian Peninsula is one of the questions we hope to answer.
            Another question we hope to answer: is there a relation between “workplace” and number of texts preserved? Does migration depend on social condition?</p>
        <p>We will be looking at linguistic aspects of the text as well. Using the time-frame data extracted from the biographical part of the project, we will study diachronic variation present in the texts to answer our research question: </p>
        <p>How did the Portuguese pronoun system change throughout the Late Middle Ages?</p>
       <!-- <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
        <p>Here is where I will talk about the methodology of Helena's work. At present, I feel I cannot do them justice.</p>
        <p>For the diachronic variation study, we will choose a sample of authors from five time periods used to divide our timeline. Using the work of Williams (1962), we will mark up pronouns and categorized them, using Williams's standards, as "old" or "new".
        Then, we will determine how accurate the claims made by Williams are by looking at the distribution of the "old" and "new" pronouns across the five time periods.</p>
        <p>Here is where I will specify how the two are related.</p>
