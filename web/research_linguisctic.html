        <h2>Linguistic analysis</h2>
        <p>How did the Portuguese pronoun system change throughout the Late Middle Ages?</p>
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>For the diachronic variation study, we will choose a sample of authors from five time periods used to divide our timeline. Using the work of Williams (1962), we will mark up pronouns and categorized them, using Williams's standards, as "old" or "new".
            Then, we will determine how accurate the claims made by Williams are by looking at the distribution of the "old" and "new" pronouns across the five time periods.</p>
        <p>Here is where I will specify how the two are related.</p>
