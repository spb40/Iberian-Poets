            <p> Our <a href="about_main.html" target="_blank">project</a> involves two different
                research questions, and as such, the methodologies used to answer them are quite
                diverse.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in knowing how we have coded the poets' biographies, check out
                our <a href="research_maping.html" target="_blank">mapping</a> section. You can also
                find there the technical details that explain how we displayed our data using Google
                Maps and Google Earth.</p>
            <p>For more information about the use of social network analysis methods to study the
                relationships between the poets, visit the <a href="research_social-network.html"
