        <h1>Mapping Medieval Galician-Portuguese Literature and its Networks</h1>
        <div class="large">
            <p>For the mapping part of our project, we used both Google Earth and Google Maps, and
                also social network graphing.</p>
            <p>In the <a href="googlemaps.html" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> section you can find
                the different maps that depict our poets' journeys divided into five different
                periods.</p>
            <p>If you have downloaded the Google Earth plugin (or if you do not mind doing so now),
                please check out our <a href="googleearth.html" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>
                globe, which includes a timeline that allows you to see how these journeys occurred
                within a time reference.</p>
            <p>If you prefer to highlight the relationships themselves, disregarding the
                geographical references, you may find our <a href="networks.html" target="_blank"
                    >Social Network</a> graph more appealing.</p>
