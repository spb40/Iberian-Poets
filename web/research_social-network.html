        <h2>Social Network analysis</h2>
        <p>To find out which were the most relevant cultural centers in the Iberian kingdoms during
            the Middle Ages we graphed relational patterns through a social network.</p>
        <p>As we explained in the <a href="maps.html">mapping section</a>, one of the problems of
            building historical personographies is data accuracy. In our sources, the information we
            care about is very often introduced with some degree of uncertainty. Moreover, we
            studying a period of upheaval, defined by conflicts, changes and reorganizations. An
            easy location reference, such as a particular king's court, becomes a very difficult one
            when trying to transform it to some coordinates. Kings and noblemen move, and their
            courts and political influences with them. The references are often unclear, and even if
            we have tried to be as rigorous as possible, we have had to make some concessions to
            inaccuracy in favor of functionality.</p>
        <p>However, with social network methods you can be much more accurate in some ways when you
            disregard geographical data and definite time references and keep only the social
            relationships.</p>
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>To build the social network we used <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org">Cytoscape</a>, an
            open source software platform for visualizing interaction networks. Cytoscape was
            originally designed for biological research, but now it is a general platform that can
            be used to visualize and analyze network graphs of any kind involving nodes and edges
            (i.e. social networks).</p>
        <p>We transformed our personography into .csv files using XSLT. In the resources page, you
            can find all these files.</p>
        <p> Once we had our data into tables, we uploaded those into Cytoscape and created the
            initial network.</p>
        <p>We defined the columns containing the troubadours and their patrons as nodes. The period
            was chosen as the interaction value, and then we selected the nationality as an edge
            attribute. Afterwards, we uploaded the table containing the type of patron (either
            royal, noble or unknown) as a node attribute.</p>
        <p>Cytoscape automatically analyses it and gives you back an exhaustive report. This means
            that you can customize your data according to centrality measures, that is, the
            relative importance of nodes and edges in the network (the elements that keep it
            together, in other words).</p>
        <p> We customized out network data displays using Cytoscape tools. We mapped our data to
            node color, label, edge thickness, edge color, etc. according to the following
            configurations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Node size and label size depends on degree centrality. The bigger the node is, the
                highest number of ties to other nodes has.</li>
            <li>The width of the edges is related to "edge betweenness", that is the number of
                shortest paths between pairs of nodes that run along it. The thicker the stroke is,
                the larger is its influence on the transfer of relations through the network.</li>
            <li>The color of the nodes defines its type. We discern poets from the “venues” where
                they develop their cultural activity. In this last category, we express when this
                venue is a royal court, a lord patronage, or an actual geographic place.</li>
            <li>The type of stroke makes it possible to visualize the origin of the poets so, in a
                way, we still preserve part of our geographical data.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The most obvious result of our social network is that it is broken (for two sides).</p>
        <p>One of them was to be expected: some of the poets present in the corpus, the ones under
            the 5th period label, are from the XV century, that is a one hundred years long gap from
            the ones under the 4th period category.</p>
        <p>The fact that is broken at the very beginning is not as problematic as it could seem
            either. For once, there are fewer texts and authors preserved, so we have fewer
            relationships to analyze. Furthermore, even if we could not find the agents that kept
            the flow of cultural production, the geographic and historical information can help us
            here to find the connections. Rodrigo Gomez, count of Trastamara, was a member of the <a
                href="http://fmg.ac/Projects/MdLands/Galicia.htm#_Toc342112890">House of Traba</a>,
            so that node would not be broken if we had encoded relationships between patronages as
            well as the flow of poets through courts. If you want to learn more about medieval

                >here</a> the work by Cawley, Charles (2006): Medieval Lands. Foundation for
            Medieval Genealogy. </p><p>Points to make (in progress):</p>
        <ul>
            <li> The origin of the Galician-Portuguese poetry school is intimately related to
                Galician noble houses.</li>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_X_of_Castile">Alfonso X</a>'s court is
                the most important node of the network. He is the responsible for a boom of cultural
                activity in the third quarter of the XIII century. It is important to point out
                about scriptoria > more texts preserved and not only that those were the “golden
                years”.</li>
