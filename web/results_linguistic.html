        <h1>Linguistic Results</h1>
        <h2>Using eXide</h2>
        <p>First, we counted how many pronouns of all the pronouns we marked were archaic and how
            many were modern. We used XQuery to do so:</p>
        <div class="code2">
            <pre>
declare namespace tei="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0";
let $docTexts := doc('/course/iberian/data/songTextsThirdTry.xml')/tei:TEI
let $docFeat := doc('/course/iberian/aux/features.xml')/tei:TEI
let $modern := $docTexts//tei:w[substring(@ana,2) = 
    $docFeat//tei:fs[tokenize(@feats/string(),'\s+') = '#archaic']/@xml:id]
return $modern/string()</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Then we used another query to filter the results by period:</p>
        <div class="code2">
            <pre>
let $period := $docTexts//tei:div[descendant::tei:affiliation/@corresp='1']
let $modern := $period//tei:w[substring(@ana,2) = 
    $docFeat//tei:fs[tokenize(@feats/string(),'\s+') = '#archaic']/@xml:id]
return $modern</pre>
        </div>
        <h2>The Numbers</h2>
        <p>In the texts, we found 137 total pronouns, both archaic and modern. The breakdown looked
            like this: </p><br />
        <img src="images/pronounChart.png" />
        <p>As you can see, in every period, across time, the majority of pronouns used were
            considered modern by Williams' standards. The breakdown of pronouns in percentages can
            be seen here:</p>

            <tr class="head">
                <th class="empty"></th>

            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>27%</td>

        <p>There are several forms that appeared in the texts that Williams did not account for in
            his studies. One of these was the pronoun <em>"lhi"</em>, an archaic form of the modern
            "lhe". Another archaic form that was not documented by Williams was present in the text.
            While Williams did account for "lis", he did not inlcude <em>"lhis"</em> which was
            present in our texts. He also did not document <em>"xi"</em> which appeared in our texts
            as the archaic form of "se". These pronouns could be absent from William's documentation
            for various reasons, such as dialectal variation and a different sample of texts. </p>
        <h2>So What?</h2>
        <p>The chonological breakdown of the periods is as such:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Period 1: 1109-1225</li>
            <li>Period 2: 1225-1250</li>
            <li>Period 3: 1250-1300</li>
            <li>Period 4: 1300-1354</li>
            <li>Period 5: 1440-1460</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Williams offers that the earliest documentation of archaic Portuguese appeared at the end
            of the 12th century, which holds true with our findings here. However, a gradual change
            from archaic to modern pronouns is not readily apparent in our data. Instead, there is
            general trend of modern pronoun dominance throughout the texts. This could be due to a
            lack of variance in the sample texts we used. We used a small sample of texts that don't
            offer as clear a picture of diachronic variation as a larger sampling would; indeed it
            would be foolish to think that an entire language change could be represented in a
            series of 19 poems. Still, our research shows that our poets, and perhaps by extension
            the Galician-Portuguese troubadors of the Middle Ages as a whole, tended towards the
            more modern forms of Portuguese pronouns. An extension of this study could look at
            larger sample size and could include more linguistic features, such as syntax and other
            morphological features, but for now, we must regard this project as a starting point for
            future projects. </p>
