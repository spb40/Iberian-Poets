        <h2>Social Network analysis</h2>
        <p>NEEDS TO BE PROOFREAD. KEEP READING AT YOUR OWN RISK</p>
        <p>To find out which were the most relevant cultural centers in the Iberian kingdoms during
            the Middle Ages we graphed relational patterns through a social network.</p>
        <p>As we explained in the <a href="maps.html">mapping section</a>, one of the problems of
            building historical personographies is data accuracy. In our sources, the information we
            care about is very often introduced with some degree of uncertainty. Moreover, we
            studying a period of upheaval, defined by conflicts, changes and reorganizations. An
            easy location reference, such as a particular king's court, becomes a very difficult one
            when trying to transform it to some coordinates. Kings and noblemen move, and their
            courts and political influences with them. The references are often unclear, and even if
            we have tried to be as rigorous as possible, we have had to make some concessions to
            inaccuracy in favor of functionality.</p>
        <p>However, with social network methods you can be much more accurate in some ways when you
            disregard geographical data and definite time references and keep only the social
            relationships.</p>
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To build the social network we used <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org"
                >Cytoscape</a>, an open source software platform for visualizing interaction
                networks. Cytoscape was originally designed for biological research, but now it is a
                general platform that can be used to visualize and analyze network graphs of any
                kind involving nodes and edges (i.e. social networks).</li>
            <li>We transformed our personography into .csv files using XSLT. <div class="code">
                    <pre>
&lt;xsl:output method="text"/&gt;
    &lt;!--Some other template rules--&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match="location"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
        &lt;xsl:when test="./@corresp"&gt;
            &lt;xsl:value-of
                    select="concat(ancestor::person/persName, ';', 
                        ancestor::person/nationality/@key, ';',
                        parent::floruit/@period, ';', 
                        following::place[@xml:id = 
                        current()/substring(@corresp, 2)]/
                        location/placeName[@type='short'],
                        ';', following::place[@xml:id = 
                        current()/substring(@corresp, 2)]/@type ,
                        '&amp;#x0a;')"
                        /&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
        &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
            &lt;xsl:value-of
                    select="concat(ancestor::person/persName,';', 
                    ancestor::person/nationality/@key, ';', 
                    parent::floruit/@period, ';', placeName, ';', 
                    @type,'&amp;#x0a;')"
                    /&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;        
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li> Once we had our data into tables, we uploaded those into Cytoscape and created the
                initial network.</li>
            <li>We defined the columns containing the troubadours and their patrons as nodes. The
                period was chosen as the interaction value, and then we selected the nationality as
                an edge attribute. Afterwards, we uploaded the table containing the type of patron
                (either royal, noble or unknown) as a node attribute.</li>
            <li>Cytoscape automatically analyses it and gives you back an exhaustive report. This
                means that you can customize your data according to centrality measures, that is,
                the relative importance of nodes and edges in the network (the elements that keep it
                together, in other words).</li>
            <li> We customized out network data displays using Cytoscape tools. We mapped our data
                to node color, label, edge thickness, edge color, etc. according to the following
                configurations: <ul>
                    <li>Node size and label size depends on <span id="degreecentrality"
                            style="font-weight:bold">degree centrality</span>. The bigger the node
                        is, the highest number of ties to other nodes has.</li>
                    <li>The width of the edges is related to "<span id="edgebetweenness"
                            style="font-weight:bold">edge betweenness</span>", that is the number of
                        shortest paths between pairs of nodes that run along it. The thicker the
                        stroke is, the larger is its influence on the transfer of relations through
                        the network.</li>
                    <li>The color of the nodes defines its type. We discern poets from the “venues”
                        where they develop their cultural activity. In this last category, we
                        express when this venue is a royal court, a lord patronage, or an actual
                        geographic place.</li>
                    <li>The type of stroke makes it possible to visualize the origin of the poets
                        so, in a way, we still preserve part of our geographical data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The most obvious result of our social network is that it is broken (for two sides).</p>
        <p>One of them was to be expected: some of the poets present in the corpus, the ones under
            the 5th period label, are from the XV century, that is a one hundred years long gap from
            the ones under the 4th period category.</p>
        <p>The fact that is broken at the very beginning is not as problematic as it could seem
            either. For once, there are fewer texts and authors preserved, so we have fewer
            relationships to analyze. Furthermore, even if we could not find the agents that kept
            the flow of cultural production, the geographic and historical information can help us
            here to find the connections. Rodrigo Gomez, count of Trastámara, was a member of the <a
                href="http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/Galicia.htm">House of Traba</a>, so that node
            would not be broken if we had encoded relationships between patronages as well as the
            flow of poets through courts. If you want to learn more about medieval genealogies, you
            can browse <a href="http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/CONTENTS.htm">here</a> the work by
            Cawley, Charles (2006): <em>Medieval Lands. Foundation for Medieval Genealogy</em>.</p>
        <p>As a summary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the most important matters when studying a particular cultural movement is to
                find out how and where it began. This socia network points out that the origin of
                the Galician-Portuguese poetry school is intimately related to Galician noble
                houses.</li>
            <li>Without any doubts, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfonso_X_of_Castile"
                    >Alfonso X</a>'s court is the most important node of the network. He is the
                responsible for a boom of cultural activity in the third quarter of the XIII
                century, and we can attest that hosting poets was part of his cultural
                program.<br /> Another aspect we must consider is that, as part of the cultural
                activity promoted in this court, they stablished scriptoria dedicated to the
                translation and copy of texts. This may explain why we have much more preserved texts and
                poets from this period than from any other one.</li>
