            <h2>Mapping Medieval Galician-Portuguese Literature and its Networks</h2>
            <p>For the mapping part of our project, we used both Google Earth and Google Maps, and
                also social network graphing.</p>
            <p>In the <a href="googlemaps.html">Google Maps</a> section you can find the different
                maps that depict our poets' journeys divided into five different periods.</p>
            <p>If you have downloaded the Google Earth plugin (or if you do not mind doing so now),
                please check out our <a href="googleearth.html">Google Earth</a> globe, which
                includes a timeline that allows you to see how these journeys occurred within a time
                reference.</p>
            <p>If you prefer to highlight the relationships themselves, disregarding the
                geographical references, you may find our <a href="networks.html">Social Network</a>
                graph more appealing.</p>
