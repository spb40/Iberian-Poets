        <h2>Mapping Medieval Galician-Portuguese Poets</h2>
        <p>NEEDS TO BE PROOFREAD. KEEP READING AT YOUR OWN RISK</p>
        <p>Between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, there was a poetic movement in the
            Galician-Portuguese language throughout the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula (with the
            exception of Catalonia where they used Provençal). Medieval Galician-Portuguese
                <em>Cantigas</em> (songs) remain as one of the richest parts of Iberian Peninsula's
            Middle Ages heritage.</p>
        <p>One thousand six hundred seventy nine songs written by 187 troubadours and minstrels
            arrived to us in the form of the <em><a
                    href="http://cantigas.fcsh.unl.pt/manuscritos.asp?ling=eng"
                >Cancioneiros</a></em> (sonbooks). In these project, we analize some of these
            troubadours through time and space with the intention of gaining a better understanding
            of how this poetic school had developed from a socio-historic point of view.</p>
        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The personography <ul>
                    <li>Using the <em><a href="http://cantigas.fcsh.unl.pt/index.asp?ling=eng">Base
                                de datos da Lírica Profana Galego-Portuguesa (MedDB)</a></em> as our
                        main source, we selected fifty-two troubadours attending to diachronic
                        criteria. We chose very poet from the first, fourth and five periods: their
                        lower number forced us to do so, because otherwise we would not be working
                        with a significant corpus. From the second period, we left out the seven
                        poets with the lowest certainty about their biographies. For the selection
                        of the poets from the third period, which represents 75% of the corpus,
                        besides certainty, we added other criteria such as the origin (selecting
                        every poet who wasn't Galician or Portuguese, so other nationalities were
                        represented) or the number of songs preserved (as a way to discern the most
                        important authors).</li>
                    <li>We used <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/Roma">TEI Roma</a> to customize our
                        XML schema (read more at the <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml">Text
                            Encoding Initiative</a> site).</li>
                    <li>For each poet, we marked-up his name, nationality, birthplace, social
                        status, occupation, and affiliation. We looked up this information into both
                        in the <em><a href="http://cantigas.fcsh.unl.pt/index.asp?ling=eng"
                                >MedDB</a></em> and the <em><a
                                href="http://www.cirp.es/pls/bdo2/f?p=103:2:4773368442203375810"
                                >Cantigas Medievais Galego Portuguesas</a></em> databases. We have
                        also used <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>
                        </em> to get additional biographical information (especially of kings and
                        counts).</li>
                    <li>We added a <code>@certainty</code></li>
                    <li> We used <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a> and <a
                            href="http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/">GeoHack</a> to find the
                        coordinates of every geographical reference we had in the personography.
                        introduced them inside a <code>&lt;geo&gt;</code>. Since we didn't use a
                            <code>&lt;geoDecl&gt;</code> element in the TEI to define a coordinate
                        system, we marked them up following the TEI default for such cases: the
                        contents of our <code>&lt;geo&gt;</code> element are a pair of numbers
                        separated by whitespace, to be interpreted as latitude followed by longitude
                        according to the World Geodetic System.</li>
                    <li>We marked-up an ancillary file with every one of the affiliations,
                        specifying whether it depended on a royal or a lordship patronage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The KML files <ul>
                    <li>As a first step, we used XSLT for a XML to XML transformation in which we
                        modified the coordinates to the KML standard, that is: three numbers
                        separated by a comma, the first of them being the longitude, followed by the
                        latitude and the altitude. Since the altitude reference was meaningless for
                        our project, we added a 100 value as a default.</li>
                    <li>Then we employed XSLT again to transform the recently created XML file to
                        KML.</li>
                    <li>This transformation included two different <code>&lt;Placemark&gt;</code>
                        elements for each poet: one for their birthplace and one for their
                        "journey." Inside the second one, the coordinates were inserted as children
                        of a <code>&lt;LineString&gt;</code> element to draw the paths. There was
                        also a <code>&lt;Placemark&gt;</code> element for every one of the
                        affiliations. Since we had added <code>@certainty</code> attributes to
                        mark-up the information that was dubious according to our sources, we
                        referred to those values in our XSLT to create different
                            <code>&lt;IconStyle&gt;</code> elements.</li>
                    <li>We used the <code>@period</code> attribute of our personography to create
                        five different KML files so we would have, as a result, one map for each
                        period.</li>
                    <li>For one of the transformations, instead of using the <code>@period</code>
                        attribute as a filter, we introduced the range of years we had inside a
                            <code>&lt;TimeSpan&gt;</code> element.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Embeding the maps in our website <ul>
                    <li>We uploaded the KML files into <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google
                            Maps</a>.</li>
                    <li>Then we opened in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps-engine/"
                            >Google Maps Engine API</a>.</li>
                    <li>After adding an additional description to our maps, we published them, we
                        changed the sharing settings to "Public" and got the "shared link" that we
                        introduced in our HTML file inside an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>
                        element.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>WORK IN PROGRESS - RANDOM</p>
        <p>Some problems and how we solve them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Certainty attributes</li>
            <li>Nationality values for locating poets</li>
        </ul>
