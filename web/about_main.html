        <h1>Mapping Medieval Galician-Portuguese Literature and its Networks</h1>
        <h2>About the Class</h2>
        <p>This project is a course requirement for Computational Methods in the Humanities, taught
            by David Birnbaum in the Fall semester of 2014 at the University of Pittsburgh</p>
        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>There are two aspects of this project: the mapping and linguistic study. </p>
        <p>In the Middle Ages, the Galician-Portuguese lyric was a very important poetic school,
            since it was the language used in nearly all of Iberia for lyric poetry. Its
            significance lies in its status as the first cultural production documented in Galicia
            or Portugal which is not written in Latin and represents not only the beginnings but one
            of the high points of poetic history in both countries and Medieval Europe. To
            understand how this poetic school worked it is important to see the relations between
            the people involved. We want to depict these relations in a map to find out which were
            the cultural centers of the time, and, therefore, who were the political agents that
            held them. “Who was boss?” in the High and Late Middle Ages in the Iberian Peninsula is
            one of the questions we hope to answer.</p>
        <p>We will be looking at linguistic aspects of this poetic school corpus as well. Using the
            time-frame data extracted from the biographical information we used to build the maps,
            we will study diachronic variation present in the texts. The research question that will
            focus the linguistic study is: How did the Portuguese pronoun system change throughout
            the Late Middle Ages? </p>
