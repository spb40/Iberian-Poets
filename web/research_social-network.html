        <h1>Social Network Analysis</h1>
        <p>To find out which were the most relevant cultural centers in the Iberian kingdoms during
            the Middle Ages we graphed relational patterns through a <a
                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis" target="_blank">social
                network</a> that you can find <a href="networks.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>As we explained in the <a href="maps.html" target="_blank">mapping section</a>, one of
            the problems of building historical personographies is data accuracy. In our sources,
            the information we care about is very often introduced with some degree of uncertainty.
            Moreover, we studying a period of upheaval, defined by conflicts, changes and
            reorganizations. An easy location reference, such as a particular king's court, becomes
            a very difficult one when trying to transform it to some coordinates. Kings and noblemen
            move, and their courts and political influences with them. The references are often
            unclear, and even if we have tried to be as rigorous as possible, we have had to make
            some concessions to inaccuracy in favor of functionality.</p>
        <p>However, with social network methods you can be much more accurate in some ways when you
            disregard geographical data and definite time references and keep only the social
            relationships.</p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To build the social network we used <a href="http://www.cytoscape.org"
                    target="_blank">Cytoscape</a>, an open source software platform for visualizing
                interaction networks. Cytoscape was originally designed for biological research, but
                now it is a general platform that can be used to visualize and analyze network
                graphs of any kind involving nodes and edges (i.e. social networks).</li>
            <li>We transformed our personography into .csv files using XSLT. <div class="code">
                    <pre>
&lt;xsl:output method="text"/&gt;
    &lt;!--Some other template rules--&gt;
&lt;xsl:template match="location"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
        &lt;xsl:when test="./@corresp"&gt;
            &lt;xsl:value-of
                    select="concat(ancestor::person/persName, ';', 
                        ancestor::person/nationality/@key, ';',
                        parent::floruit/@period, ';', 
                        following::place[@xml:id = 
                        current()/substring(@corresp, 2)]/
                        location/placeName[@type='short'],
                        ';', following::place[@xml:id = 
                        current()/substring(@corresp, 2)]/@type ,
                        '&amp;#x0a;')"
                        /&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:when&gt;
        &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;
            &lt;xsl:value-of
                    select="concat(ancestor::person/persName,';', 
                    ancestor::person/nationality/@key, ';', 
                    parent::floruit/@period, ';', placeName, ';', 
                    @type,'&amp;#x0a;')"
                    /&gt;
        &lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;        
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</pre>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li> Once we had our data into tables, we uploaded those into Cytoscape and created the
                initial network.</li>
            <li>We defined the columns containing the troubadours and their patrons as nodes. The
                period was chosen as the interaction value, and then we selected the nationality as
                an edge attribute. Afterwards, we uploaded the table containing the type of patron
                (either royal, noble or unknown) as a node attribute.</li>
            <li>Cytoscape automatically analyses the data and gives you back an exhaustive report.
                This means that you can customize your graph according to centrality measures, that
                is, the relative importance of nodes and edges in the network (the elements that
                keep it together, in other words).</li>
            <li> We customized the graphic elements of the network using Cytoscape buid-in tools. We
                mapped our data to node color, label, edge thickness, edge color, etc. according to
                the following configurations: <ul>
                    <li>Node size and label size depends on <span id="degreecentrality">degree
                            centrality</span>. The bigger the node is, the highest number of ties to
                        other nodes has.</li>
                    <li>The width of the edges is related to "<span id="edgebetweenness">edge
                            betweenness</span>", that is the number of shortest paths between pairs
                        of nodes that run along it. The thicker the stroke is, the larger is its
                        influence on the transfer of relations through the network.</li>
                    <li>The color of the nodes defines its type. We discern poets from the “venues”
                        where they develop their cultural activity. In this last category, we
                        express when this venue is a royal court, a lord patronage, or an actual
                        geographic place.</li>
                    <li>The type of stroke makes it possible to visualize the origin of the poets
                        so, in a way, we still preserve part of our geographical data.</li>
                </ul>
